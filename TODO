To do:
- Maybe opponent's ships should each calculate kill_priority values for themselves? Then they could take into account their own hit bonuses and initiative and damage output and so on.
- Generally speaking, make the combat algorithm much better. The goal is to do maximum damage while minimizing the return damage. This is the most complicated part of the program so I'm putting it off.
- At one point I got rid of the owner_id and owner_name attributes of the Ship class and replaced them with self.owner (the Player object). In practice this slows the code down by a factor of 100 or more. Use the profiler to figure out what's going on.
- Fix doc strings to be PEP8 compliant, do a general pass on style
