To do:
- Generally speaking, make the combat algorithm much better. The goal is to do maximum damage while minimizing the return damage. This is the most complicated part of the program so I'm putting it off.


Things we'll need to improve the algorithm:

- With a collection of attacks, need to figure out which ships we can hit
- Make damage assignment a Ship class method. When ships are damaged they should recalculate their own kill priority. Also, shouldn't need to sort fleets by kill priority. That's hecka janky.
