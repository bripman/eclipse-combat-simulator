# eclipse-combat-simulator
A collection of python scripts that simulates fleet combat in the 4X board game Eclipse.

This was the final project for an online Python class I took in 2015. Now that I'm not working under a deadline I intend to polish it and finish implementing various features that were missing in the original.

This is also my first GitHub project.
